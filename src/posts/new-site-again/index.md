title: new site (...again)
---

It's that time of year again. Yes, you got it right, it's time to completely rewrite this dumb website again and overengineer it even more just for me to forget about it for the next 2 years and do the thing again!

This time for my trendy ass tech stack we're using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's not like I care all that much though, as I still absolutely despise web development, especially frontend web development. But hey, I'm getting somewhere this time by using an SSG that I actually understand! Not only that, but I've also learned a lot of things about the modern webdev ecosystem. Like the fact that it still stinks and I don't want to touch it with a stick ever again.

So what does 11ty actually help with?

Well... not much. Except that I have a much deeper understanding of this system than the previous one, so I have more room for fancy stuff. What fancy stuff?

_Observe_.

```javascript
const hello = ["oh", "god", "please", "make", "it", "stop"];
let world = hello.join(" ");

console.log(world);
```

```haskell
import Data.List

hello :: [String]
hello = ["thank", "you", "very", "much", ":)"]

world :: String
world = intercalate " " hello

main = putStrLn world
```

Oh, and I guess the site is more maintainable now, which in turn will make it easier for me to write new stuff for it. Don't take that as a guarantee, though, as I'm still just as much of a lazy prick as I was before.
